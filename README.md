## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork & Clone the Repository

To use the bot in your project, fork this repository and clone it to your local machine:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nvminh/ai-code-review-bot.git
cd ai-code-review-bot
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up GitHub Actions
The bot is designed to run automatically as a GitHub Action whenever a pull request is created or updated.

To enable it, simply copy the `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` file from this repository to your project‚Äôs `.github/workflows/` directory.

If you don‚Äôt have a `.github/workflows/` folder in your project, create one and then add the workflow file.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add API Key for OpenAI
Since the bot uses OpenAI for reviewing code, you need to set up the **OpenAI API Key** in your repository‚Äôs **GitHub Secrets**.

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** in your GitHub repository.
2. Click **New repository secret**.
3. Name it **OPENAI_API_KEY** and paste your OpenAI API key as the value.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger AI Code Review
Once the workflow is set up, the AI Code Review Bot will run automatically whenever a pull request is created or updated. The bot will:

1. Fetch PR changes and analyze them using OpenAI.
2. Post general feedback as a comment on the PR.
3. Add inline comments for specific suggestions.
4. If no major issues are found, the bot will approve the PR.
5. If issues are detected, the bot will **not approve** the PR and will provide **clear suggestions on how to get it approved**.
